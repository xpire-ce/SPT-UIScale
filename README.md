# SPT-UIScale

BepInEx client plugin for SPT 4.1.1 that unlocks UI scaling for the inventory and trader screens. Overrides EFT's hardcoded 1080p canvas scaling with a configurable percentage, and adjusts panel layouts so the stash and gear panels properly fill the screen at higher resolutions.

## Features

- Configurable UI scale as a percentage of vanilla (50–150%)
- Automatically adjusts when changing resolution in-game
- Inventory screen: gear panel expands to fill available space, stash anchored to the right
- Trader screen: trader items anchored left, stash anchored right, deal panel centered
- Works with any resolution (1440p, 4K, ultrawide, etc.)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release ZIP
2. Extract into your SPT installation directory — the DLL goes to `BepInEx/plugins/`
3. Launch SPT

## Configuration

After first launch, edit `BepInEx/config/com.vonbraunz.uiscale.cfg`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Enabled** | `true` | Toggle the mod on/off without uninstalling |
| **Scale Percent** | `100` | UI scale as a percentage of vanilla. `100` = no change, `75` = 75% size (more grid space), `50` = half size. Range: 50–150 |
| **Log Canvas Names** | `false` | Debug logging to BepInEx console |

### Recommended values

| Resolution | Scale Percent | Effect |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| 1080p | 100 | No change (vanilla) |
| 1440p | 75–85 | More inventory/stash space |
| 4K | 50–75 | Significantly more grid space |

## How It Works

EFT uses a central UI scale manager (`UICanvasScalerController`) that forces all canvases to a 1080p reference resolution via `ConstantPixelSize` scaling. Every frame it calculates `Min(screenWidth/1920, screenHeight/1080)` and applies that to all registered `CanvasScaler` components.

This mod patches that pipeline:

1. **CanvasScalerPatch** — intercepts `UICanvasScalerController.ChangeCanvasScalerRestriction` and multiplies the game's auto-calculated scale factor by your configured percentage
2. **InventoryStretchPatch** — hooks `InventoryScreen.Show()` to reanchor the gear and stash panels so they fill the wider canvas
3. **TraderStretchPatch** — hooks `TraderScreensGroup.Show()` to reanchor the trader items and stash panels

## Building

Requires the SPT 4.1.1 client installed at `C:\SPT\ModTest\` (or override `TarkovDir` in the `.csproj`).

```
dotnet build Client/UIScale.Client.csproj -c Release
```

Output: `Client/bin/Release/UIScale.Client.dll` and `Client/release/UIScale.zip`

## Compatibility

- SPT 4.1.1
- BepInEx 5.x
- No server-side component required
